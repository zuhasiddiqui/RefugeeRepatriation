This program is an analysis of Afghan refugee repatriation data �from 2014-2018. 
I scraped 2018 repatriation data from data.humdata.org. I then saved the that data in a file called Refugeedata.csv. Data for 2014-2017, I downloaded from data.humdata.org
The program attempts to isolate instances where refugees ended up in districts that they weren’t originally from, and then prints them to five different files – each file representing one year. 

-- The code's a little messy though, because I'm still figuring python out. I'm also a journalist, not a data scientist!
